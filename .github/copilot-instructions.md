## AI Assistant

- Always use context7 to look up library or API documentation when needed.
- If you are unsure about a specific implementation detail, ask for clarification.
- **NEVER run git commands or commit changes**. The user will handle all git operations themselves.

## Coding Best Practices

- Follow modern best practices for code style, readability, and maintainability, regardless of language.
- Prioritize code consistency and clear naming conventions.
- Unless otherwise instructed, always apply these guidelines automatically.

### Python
- Prefer using `pathlib` for path and file operations instead of legacy modules like `os.path` or `glob`.
- Use type annotations, f-strings, comprehensions, and other modern Python features whenever possible.
