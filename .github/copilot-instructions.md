# Copilot Instructions: Coding Best Practices

- Follow modern best practices for code style, readability, and maintainability, regardless of language.
- Prioritize code consistency and clear naming conventions.
- Unless otherwise instructed, always apply these guidelines automatically.

## Python
- Prefer using `pathlib` for path and file operations instead of legacy modules like `os.path` or `glob`.
- Use type annotations, f-strings, comprehensions, and other modern Python features whenever possible.
